# rock-paper-scissors

## What is this project?

This is a project that currently a very simple html-based UI to play a simple game of rock paper scissors against a computer. I made it as part of The Odin Project and actually quite enjoyed solving the puzzle of making this.

## What have I learnt?

~~I learnt more about applying javascript whilst doing this project, such as generating random values and evaluating user input against computer generated input.~~

It was also a good opportunity to better hone my troubleshooting and problem solving skils, with ample opportunity to debug whilst programming this.

I've learnt the above, as well as manipulating the DOM using javascript.

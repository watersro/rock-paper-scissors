# rock-paper-scissors

## What is this project?

This is a project that currently uses alerts/ prompts to play a simple game of rock paper scissors against a computer. I made it as part of Th eOdin Project and actually quite enjoyed solving the puzzle of making this.

## What did I learn?

I learnt more about applying javascript whilst doing this project, such as generating random values and evaluating user input against computer generated input.

It was also a good opportunity to better hone my troubleshooting and problem solving skils, with ample opportunity to debug whilst programming this.
